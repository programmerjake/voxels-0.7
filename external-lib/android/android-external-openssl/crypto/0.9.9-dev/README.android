This directory does not exist in the OpenSSL distribution.

It has been added to import assembler code from OpenSSL 0.9.9-dev
(ftp://ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/).  The assembler files (.s) were
generated by running the Perl files (.pl), with ".align 2" appended
to avoid assembler error messages where needed.
